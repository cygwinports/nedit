ldesc: "NEdit is a multi-purpose text editor for the X Window System, 
which combines a standard, easy to use, graphical user interface with 
the thorough functionality and stability required by users who edit 
text eight hours a day. It provides intensive support for development 
in a wide variety of languages, text processors, and other tools, but 
at the same time can be used productively by just about anyone who 
needs to edit text."
